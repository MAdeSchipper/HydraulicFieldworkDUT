Easy Scripts for Analysis of Hydraulic Engineering 


This toolbox provides a few scripts to analyse coastal engineering processes and data.
These scripts are intended to be as simple as possible, such that they can be adapted by students.

For better and advanced scripts for data analysis and model interfacing, please use the Open Earth Toolbox.
It is free and well tested.
